This allows us to slowly step through the code (using the 's' command). The displayed '->' in the source code shows where the execution is at. One step and we enter the run() function. One more and we land on variable 'c' that is getting initialized. Bad name, as it would conflict with the c(ontinue) command of the debugger if we were to interrogate its value. Its value, however,  can still be displayed using `print(c)` at the debugger's prompt. Now let's use 'n' to avoid going down in the rabbit hole of called sub functions.\n",

Value and die seem to match. The error is that total does not properly add values while it is iterating over the dice. We found one bug and its solution so that you now know how to fix the `answer()` method.\n",
